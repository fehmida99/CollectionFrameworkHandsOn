Here are 20 interview questions along with their answers, focusing on the `Map` interface and its implemented classes (`HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, `Hashtable`, `SortedMap`, and `TreeMap`):

**1. Q: What is the primary purpose of the `Map` interface in Java?**

   A: The `Map` interface represents a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with exactly one value.




**2. Q: Explain the difference between a `HashMap` and a `Hashtable`.**

   A: Both are implementations of the `Map` interface, but `HashMap` is not synchronized, allowing better performance in a non-thread-safe environment, while `Hashtable` is synchronized, ensuring thread safety.





**3. Q: What is the significance of the `LinkedHashMap` class?**

   A: `LinkedHashMap` maintains the order of insertion, providing predictable iteration order based on the order in which entries were added.





**4. Q: How does the `put()` method work in a `HashMap`?**

   A: The `put(key, value)` method in a `HashMap` associates the specified value with the specified key. If the key already exists, the old value is replaced with the new one.





**5. Q: Can a `HashMap` contain `null` keys or values?**

   A: Yes, a `HashMap` can contain one `null` key and multiple `null` values.





**6. Q: How does a `LinkedHashMap` iterate through its entries?**

   A: `LinkedHashMap` iterates through its entries in the order in which they were inserted. This order can be either in the order of key insertion or access, depending on the constructor used.





**7. Q: What is the purpose of the `containsKey()` method in the `Map` interface?**

   A: The `containsKey(key)` method checks if the map contains a mapping for the specified key and returns `true` if present, `false` otherwise.





**8. Q: Explain the difference between `HashMap` and `LinkedHashMap` in terms of performance.**

   A: `HashMap` generally offers better performance for basic operations, as it does not maintain the order of insertion like `LinkedHashMap`.






**9. Q: How does the `put()` method handle collisions in a `HashMap`?**

   A: In the case of a collision (when two keys hash to the same bucket), a linked list of entries is maintained in each bucket. New entries are added to the linked list.





**10. Q: Can a `Hashtable` contain `null` keys or values?**

    A: No, `Hashtable` does not allow `null` keys or values. Attempting to insert `null` will result in a `NullPointerException`.




**11. Q: What is the difference between a `SortedMap` and a `NavigableMap`?**

    A: `NavigableMap` extends `SortedMap` and adds navigation methods such as `lowerKey()`, `higherKey()`, etc., providing navigation capabilities for ordered maps.





**12. Q: How does a `TreeMap` differ from a `HashMap` in terms of ordering?**

    A: `TreeMap` maintains elements in sorted order based on their natural ordering or a specified comparator, while `HashMap` does not guarantee any specific order.







**13. Q: How does the `get()` method work in a `HashMap`?**

    A: The `get(key)` method in a `HashMap` returns the value associated with the specified key. If the key is not present, it returns `null`.





**14. Q: What is the significance of the `Hashtable` class in terms of thread safety?**

    A: `Hashtable` is synchronized, making it thread-safe. All its methods are synchronized, which ensures that multiple threads can access and modify it safely.






**15. Q: How does the `remove()` method work in a `HashMap`?**

    A: The `remove(key)` method removes the mapping for the specified key. If the key is not present, it does nothing.





**16. Q: Explain the purpose of the `TreeMap` class.**

    A: `TreeMap` is a sorted map implementation that maintains elements in ascending order based on their natural ordering or a specified comparator.




**17. Q: What is the difference between the `put()` method in `HashMap` and `put()` in `Hashtable`?**

    A: The `put()` method in both classes is used to associate a value with a key. However, in `Hashtable`, it is synchronized, while in `HashMap`, it is not.






**18. Q: Can a `LinkedHashMap` contain duplicate keys?**

    A: No, a `LinkedHashMap` does not allow duplicate keys. If an attempt is made to insert a duplicate key, the old value associated with the key is replaced.





**19. Q: How does the `clear()` method work in a `HashMap`?**

    A: The `clear()` method in a `HashMap` removes all mappings, leaving the map empty. It does not affect the capacity of the map.





**20. Q: Explain the significance of the `ceilingKey()` method in the `NavigableMap` interface.**

    A: The `ceilingKey(key)` method returns the least key greater than or equal to the specified key, or `null` if there is no such key.
