In this Java collections framework tutorial, we have to learn following topics in depth.

What is Collection in Java?
Realtime examples of Collection
Types of objects stored in Collection (container) object
What is the need for Collections in Java?
What is Collections Framework in Java?
Difference between Array and Collection in Java and many more.    

   
   
What is Collection in Java:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   
A collection is a group of objects. In Java, these objects are called elements of the collection. 
Let’s understand it with some realtime examples.
   
1. In childhood, you had a kiddy bank. In the kiddy bank, you had collected a lot of coins. This kiddy bank is called collection and the coins are nothing but objects.

2. During school time, you put all the important books in the school bag before going to school. Here Schoolbag is a collection and books are objects.

3. A classroom is a collection of students. So, the classroom is nothing but a collection and students are objects.

4. We know that the entire world is a collection of humans, animals, and different things. The world is a collection and humans, animals and different things are different objects.
   
   
Technically, a collection is an object or container which stores a group of other objects as a single unit or single entity. Therefore, it is also known as container object or collection object in java.



A simple example of a collection is given below:
// Create a container list of cities (objects or elements). 
   List<String> city = new ArrayList<String>();

// Adding names of cities.
   city.add(“Kolkata”);
   city.add(“Pune”);
   city.add(“Mumbai”);
   
   
Difference between Arrays & Collections in Java
The difference between arrays and collections are as follows:

1. Arrays are fixed in size but collections are growable in nature. We can increase or decrease size.

2. Arrays are not recommended to use with respect to memory whereas collections are recommended to use with respect to memory.

3. Arrays are recommended to use with respect to performance but collections are not recommended to use with respect to performance.

4. Arrays can store only homogeneous data elements (similar type of data) but collections can hold both homogeneous and heterogeneous elements.

5. Arrays do not support any method but collections support various kinds of methods.

6. Arrays can have both hold primitives and object types but collections can hold only objects but not primitive.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
            
  COLLECTION FRAMEWORK IS JAVA API WHICH PROVIDES
    ARCHITECTURE TO STORE AND MANIPULATE GROUP OF OBJECTS
    
        
    AND THE COLLECTION FRAMEWORK PROVIDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
    CLASSES THAT THEY HAVE (ALGORITHAM)
    
    
    API -> API STAND FOR  < APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE > WHICH HAVE
           PREDEFINED CLASSES AND INTERFACES
 
   IN HINDI : COLLECTION FRAMEWORK HAME CLASSES OR INTERFACES DETA HAI	
              JISKI HELP SE HUM KAHI SAARE OBJECTS KO EK GROUP MAI 
              RAKH SAKTE (COLLECTION M RAKH SAKTE HAI)
              OR HUM USS OBJECTS KO MANIPULATE (CHANGE - UPDATE)
              BHI KR SAKTE HAI OPERATION PERFORM KRKE 
              OR COLLECTION HUM OPERATION PROVIDE KRTA KI
              APP ISS TYPE OPERATION ISS OBJECTS PR KR SAKTE HO 
              
              
    
              
  WHERE IS COLLECTION FRAMEWORK IN JAVA ?
  
  IN JAVA.UTIL PACKAGE
  IF WE WANT TO USE COLLECTION IN OUR PROGRAM Then WE HAVE TO IMPORT THAT
  SOME INTERFACE OF COLLECTION FRAMEWORK ->COLLECTION MAP SET LIST QUEUE ETC
